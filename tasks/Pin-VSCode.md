## Pin Visual Studio Code in gHost

### Goals
Use gHost to pin Visual Studio Code to your toolbar.

1. Some classes (ITS 2801) use the Visual Studio Code editor. If you are taking ITS 2801, click on the "Show Apps" icon. Find the "Visual Studio Code" icon, right-click on it, and choose "Pin to Dash" and it will be added to your toolbar. Once done, you can click on the "Show Apps" icon to make the list go away.

2. Launch the "Files" application from your toolbar by clicking on it. This is very similar to the Windows File Explorer or the Finder on the Macintosh. By default, it shows you the "Home" directory associated with your account. You can manage your files and directories (folders) using this application, though you can also do so via commands which is described in other Lab activities.

## Pin Visual Studio Code in gHost

### Goals
Use gHost to pin Visual Studio Code to the toolbar.

1. Some classes (ITS 2801) use the Visual Studio Code editor. If taking ITS 2801, click on the "Show Apps" icon. Find the "Visual Studio Code" icon, right-click on it, and choose "Pin to Dash" and it will be added to the toolbar. Once done, click on the "Show Apps" icon to make the list go away.

2. Launch the "Files" application from the toolbar by clicking on it. This is very similar to the Windows File Explorer or the Finder on the Macintosh. By default, it shows the "Home" directory associated with the account. Files and directories (folders) can be managed using this application, though this can also be done via commands which is described in other Lab activities.

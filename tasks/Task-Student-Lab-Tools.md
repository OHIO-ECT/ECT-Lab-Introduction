# Student Lab Tools

## Goals

The ECT faculty strongly recommend for each student to have the following tools on their Personal Computer. These tools simplify communication with the faculty, allow students to organize knowledge, and produce high quality lab reports. Students may use different products so long as they can produce equivalent results without support.

## Resources
- Personal Computer (Desktop or Laptop)

## Environmental Context

- Personal PC and a browser

## MS Teams and MS Office

Ohio University purchases licenses from Microsoft Office 365 (O365) for every faculty, staff, and student. O365 includes online and installed PC version of Office, Productivity, and Messaging tools. These tools are recommended by the ITS department. The Microsoft Teams messaging tool included in O365 is an excellent tool for communicating with faculty for class work.

Instructions for downloading and installing O365 can be found at [OIT's Office 365 Help page](https://help.ohio.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=116).

## Text Editor

The Office 365 tools are not good a manipulating text with formatting. Many of the of the interactions with IT system are still done via text based interfaces, and can be confused by the formatting done by the office tools. A simple text editor like ``Notepad`` in Windows or ``TextEdit`` in Apple avoids the formatting issues. ``Notepad++`` the recommended text editor for ITS classes because it is able to handle nuanced differences in text formats between different operating systems.

For windows users, Notepad should already be installed. To open Notepad, press the Windows key and type "Notepad", then press Enter.

Optional: If there is no preferred Text Editor already, install Notepad++ with the instructions at: <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>

## Screen Capture Tool 

In ITS classes, you'll typically create diagrams and graphics (such as network and system diagrams) using specialized tools like Draw.IO, which will be covered in future labs. Always check your instructor's specific requirements for each class, as expectations may vary.<br>
When screenshots are specifically requested, use screen capture tools that let you select a precise region of the screen. This helps maximize focus on the relevant subject matter rather than capturing unnecessary elements.

**Note:** Photos taken with cell phone will **ONLY** be acceptable when a student is asked to document physical world work. This is **VERY RARE** in ITS classes.<br>
Mac users have several screenshot options available, though these have not been fully tested in this environment.

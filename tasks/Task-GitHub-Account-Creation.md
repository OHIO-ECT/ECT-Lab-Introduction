## GitHub Account Creation

### Goals
- A GitHub account with OHIO ID associated with it
- Email GitHub account info to course instructor(s)

### Resources

- Personal Computer (Desktop or Laptop)
- Lab notebook document

### Environmental Context

- Personal PC and a browser

### GitHub Account Creation

1. The current web page being viewed is part of a *public* "github repo". However, **all other labs will *not* be public.** In a browser open up ``www.github.com``.
<br>

2. If there is no existing account, create a GitHub account. It **MUST** use the OHIO email address to access the private repos.

    **Note:** Students with existing accounts will need to associate their OHIO email address with an existing account.
<br>

3. Send an email to the course instructors. The subject of the message needs to be the course number (e.g. ITS 2300). The body of the message should include the GitHub username (e.g. Github username: johnsmith)
<br>

4. Further labs/repos after this one cannot be accessed until the GitHub account is created and the information emailed to the instructor.

# ITS 4750 Labs

The following lab tasks serve to bootstrap the student into the ITS lab environment, review network analysis tools, explore client configurations, and most importantly present the documentation standards that are fundamental to EVERY submission in this course.

# Preface and Warnings

## Variable replacement

Through ALL ITS labs and as a general rule in public documentation various forms of brackets `[ ] < > { }" and quotes are used to signify a variable that must be replaced by the user.  The student is responsible for understanding the context of these strings, but unless otherwise specified the brackets are removed during the replacement.  For example:

`{Ohio-University-Mascot}` becomes `bobcat` NOT `{bobcat}`  

## Defining requirement levels

Lab write-ups use requirement levels that are consistent with [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2119/)

## Omissions, Errors, and Changes

The systems that are used to build the labs in this course are real production software and are subject to change.  While the Faculty, Lab Director, and Teaching Assistants attempt to find all issues prior to releasing the labs, it is very likely that changes that regularly occur in these systems will cause disruptions to the labs.

If any part of the lab is unclear for any reason, including formatting and documentation errors in the lab content, the student is 100% responsible for clarifying their observations with the faculty in class or in Teams.

# Industry impetus

The criteria for lab reports in this class are defined by the following observations:

- ALL well maintained enterprise networks are highly documented.
- Network engineers are regularly called upon to identify, resolve, and document complex problems.
- Network engineers must be able to effectively communicate with non-technical contributors (Board of Directors, CEO, CIO, manager, customer, support, purchasing, sales, etc.)

Examples of documents that network engineers may encounter in the industry:

- Proposed changes to an existing network
- Documentation of major outages
- Purchasing requests
- Request for Proposals (RFP)
- Design documentation for new networks.

# Key criteria

A student's lab reports will serve as a demonstration of their documentation skills.  Significant portions of every lab grade will reflect the faculty and graders' subjective opinion of the quality of the report's construction and its effectiveness against the documentation principles listed above.

## Documentation standards

There are many different network documentation standards.  Students SHOULD adopt the class's standards to ensure that their work is easy for the faculty and grader to process. Information on the required attributes and formatting standards can be found at [ITS Lab Reports](../tasks/ITL-Lab-Report.md)  

## Concise answers!

Students are expected to provide <u>concise</u> documentation that completely demonstrates their understanding of the work completed for every task in a lab.   Faculty and Graders will not "search for needles in haystacks" when students dump lengthy data into their lab report.

## Screenshots

Screenshots, images, JPG, etc. as documentation of network data are <u>EXTREMELY</u> rare, and will ONLY be used to document graphical user interfaces (GUI).  GUI interfaces are rare in the industry and even rarer in this class. Command Line Inputs and Outputs should NEVER be documented in screenshots.

This includes Teams conversations!

## Grading rubrics and prompts

Students are advised to check the grading rubric for each class submission, and consider the prompts for each task carefully.

```
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                READ THAT PART AGAIN
                IGNORE AT YOUR OWN RISK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       
```

## Lab 1

- [Task 1 - Student Lab Tools](../tasks/Task-Student-Lab-Tools.md)
    Student should clearly articulate the tools and ecosystems they intend to use during the semester.

- [Task 2 - GitHub Account Creation](../tasks/Task-GitHub-Account-Creation.md)
    EVERY student MUST follow this task even if they completed this task in previous semesters or for other classes. The GitHub username should also be documented in the lab report.

- [Task 3 - Connect to your gHost via Guacamole (Web Browser)](../tasks/Task-Connect-to-GNS3-VM-Guac.md)
    This web interface is available for Internet Engineering students to use.  However, Internet Engineering students are likely to have smoother interactions with larger GNS3 projects via remote desktop described in the next task.  Guacamole also provides an SSH interface to the gHost that can be helpful in debugging connectivity problems with the gHost, including the infamous "Black Screen of Death".

    This command is left for future reference.  It should NOT normally be needed.

    ```DISPLAY=:10 xmessage -iconic x```

- [Task 4 - Connect to your gHost with Remote Desktop](../tasks/Task-Connect-to-GNS3-VM.md)
    Find a creative way to demonstrate that you completed this task.  No screenshots!

- [Task 5 - GNS3 Projects](../tasks/Task-GNS3-Projects.md)
    This task may be documented with a single high quality screenshot

- [Task 6 - Terminal Shell and File Management](../tasks/Task-Terminal-Shell-and-File-Management.md)
    Students will master a number of CLI interfaces to network and server equipment.  Identify a command or tip not presented in this task.

- [Task 7 - Gathering IP Information](../tasks/Task-Gathering-IP-Information.md)
    Different runs of a particular network are very unlikely to reproduce the same results.  Particularly on Client machines.  Gather and document the information for the network interfaces connected to the cloud.  Cryptic Hint: Details, needles, matter.  Other information creates a haystack to hide the details in.  You can edit out information as long as the details don't lose context.  

- [Task 8 - Network Diagnostic Tools](../tasks/Task-Advanced-Network-Diagnostic-Commands.md)
    Have a network problem?  These are must-have tools.  Give example data from each tool and explain its operation.  Brutally direct "hint": Don't ask for help without having tried the respective tool FIRST!

- [Task 9 - Wireshark](../tasks/Task-Wireshark.md)
    Unless you have technokinesis like Professor Saunders, packet capture tools like Wireshark enable the network engineer to see.  Speaking of needles and haystacks, the output of packet capture data can be quite cumbersome.  Show the packet capture data with the proper export and nicely presented.  Highlighting critical data in a packet capture is always appreciated. 

- [Task 10 - Drawing Diagrams](../tasks/Task-Drawing-Diagrams.md)
    Digitally drawn network diagrams are a regular part of every deliverable.  Diagrams are a critical part of network documentation.  They articulate the network architecture and include significant network details.  Screenshots or image exports from GNS3 are NEVER a substitute for a drawn diagram!

- [Task 11 - Shutdown project](../tasks/Task-Shutdown-GNS3.md)
    Why would we ask students to shutdown a project when the work is complete.  Be Concise!

# Proper submissions

Unless otherwise specifically noted, students MUST submit PDF formatted documents!

# Miscellaneous tasks for information only

- [SSH Jump Host](../tasks/Task-SSH-Jumphost.md)
    gHosts and devices in projects can be accessed via SSH through a security bastion described in this task.  This option is NOT normally used.

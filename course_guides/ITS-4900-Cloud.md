# ITS Lab Guides

## Complete all of the following tasks on the student PC.

- [GitHub Account Creation](../tasks/Task-GitHub-Account-Creation.md) ensures that the student is properly connected to the class's private GitHub repositories

This class will make intensive use of command line and code interfaces.  Students will be expected to manage their own development environment.  The department will provide instructions for using the students' gHost as a development environment, and will ONLY provide support in the gHost ecosystem.  The intensity of the interaction with the gHost will make the Guacamole web interface prohibitively inconvenient.

- [Connect to your GNS3 VM with Guacamole](../tasks/Task-Connect-to-GNS3-VM-Guac.md) Initial access to the gHost. Usernames and passwords are in a file on the desktop.

- [Connect to your GNS3 VM with Remote Desktop](../tasks/Task-Connect-to-GNS3-VM.md) For People who do not want to stuck inside of a web browser are welcome to use remote desktop.

- [SSH Sessions via a Jumphost](../tasks/Task-SSH-Jumphost.md) There will be a considerable amount command line work done in this class.  While unlikely, students are welcome to SSH directly to the gHosts.

## Complete all of these tasks on the gHost

- [GitHub Authentication](../tasks/GitHub-Auth.md)
- [Pin VSCode to the start bar](../tasks/Pin-VSCode.md)

# ECT Lab Introduction - Lab Reports

Lab Reports are to be written individually (no group work). Reports will be uploaded to Canvas electronically as a **PDF** (ONLY!). Reports do not generally need to be more than several pages. Officially, they need to be "long enough to answer the questions".

An example lab report format doc: https://github.com/OHIO-ECT/ECT-Lab-Introduction/blob/main/files/ITL%20-%20Lab%20Report%20Example.pdf

There is also a Wireshark Exporting Guide: https://github.com/OHIO-ECT/Wireshark-Export-Guide

It is expected that students will read and follow these guidelines and examples.

Each lab report must have a header (**no cover pages!**) on the first page that includes:
- Student Name
- Lab section attended
- Student program affiliation (CS ugrad, CS grad, ITS ugrad, ITS grad, etc.)
- No cover sheets!
- Number your answers with the same numbers as the Lab Report Questions.
- No appendixes! 
- For terminal window data (ping, traceroute, netstat etc.) data should be formatted with a fixed width font like courier to preserve the columns and displayed as shown on screen.
- Absolutely **NO SCREEN SHOTS!** (with your phone camera or screen shot tool) There are extremely rare cases when a screen shot (usually for a web interface) will be required. This will be noted in the assignment instructions.
- Wireshark: It is absolutely NOT acceptable to provide screen shots of any kind for Wireshark data ever! Export to text.
- Terminal window (CLI) data needs to be reformatted to remove the extra line breaks. While this report is long future ones will be **much** longer. Removing the extra line breaks will save much space. A smaller font can also be used for terminal window data or adjust margins for that data to stop line wrapping.
